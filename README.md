🚀 **Introducing Our SQL Query Checker – Making SQL Error Detection Smarter!** 🛠️  

Working with SQL can sometimes be frustrating, especially when debugging syntax errors. Our team set out to solve this problem by building an **Advanced SQL Query Checker** that not only detects errors but also suggests real-time corrections.  

### 🔍 **What This Project Does:**  
✅ Identifies common SQL errors (syntax mistakes, missing semicolons, typos, etc.)  
✅ Provides suggestions for corrections (e.g., `UPDTE` → `UPDATE`, missing `FROM` clause, etc.)  
✅ Supports **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), DDL (Data Definition Language), and DML (Data Manipulation Language)** queries  
✅ Highlights incorrect table/column names if they don’t match valid SQL syntax  
✅ Improves real-time validation using **intelligent pattern recognition**  

### 🛠 **Challenges We Faced & Solutions We Implemented:**  
❌ **Only detecting basic errors like missing semicolons** → ✅ Added deeper syntax analysis for **keywords, clauses, and structure validation**  
❌ **Difficulty differentiating between SQL keywords and user-defined table/column names** → ✅ Implemented a **custom dictionary of SQL keywords** to handle this  
❌ **Handling missing clauses like `FROM`, `WHERE`, or `SET`** → ✅ Improved the logic to **detect incomplete queries and suggest fixes**  

### 🔄 **Future Improvements & What’s Next?**  
🔹 Expand validation for complex queries (joins, nested subqueries, stored procedures)  
🔹 Add an **AI-powered suggestion engine** to enhance query optimization  
🔹 Improve support for **different SQL dialects** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)  

🚀 **This project is a game-changer for developers, students, and data analysts working with SQL!**
